Issues:
1. Library incompatablility
Numba requires numpy version <=2.00, while the pandas has incompatability problem with older version numpy.

2. To further inspect and find the right versions for the libraries,
Git cloned another copy of helix, installed from that one.

3. A copy of helix has been attached under DELight_mtr directory for testing

ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
pdmongo 0.3.4 requires pandas<1.6,>=0.20, but you have pandas 2.2.3 which is incompatible.
numba 0.60.0 requires numpy<2.1,>=1.22, but you have numpy 2.2.1 which is incompatible.
strax 2.0.3 requires numpy<2.0.0,>=1.18.5, but you have numpy 2.2.1 which is incompatible.

pip install -r requirements.txt

python also need to be >3.7 <3.11
Do we have a docker for that?

The test of helix has some array method incompatability problems on my laptop.

Helix syntax used some old features, not supported.
