## Quick Notes

### Date

`2025-06-02`

### Key Points

* Definition of efficiency
* Manual inspection and stat for dark count
* 2-fold efficiency vs 1-fold

---

### Definition of efficiency
* Setup
    Individual channel fixed OF  
    ch1-44 use uv template extracted from TraceSimulator  
    ch45 uses ch45 qp template  
    [ch46:] use ch46+ qp template  
* Definition of passrate(efficiency)
    For 1fold definition: as long as one channel has ampl>threshold then we label the event as passed
    For 2fold definition: the second largest ampl>threshold then the event labeled as passed.

### Manual inspection and Stat for dark count
* Setup
    [Same as Definition of efficiency section](#Definition of efficiency)
* Manual inspection
    1. There are some noise shows similar general shape as the template with ampl around 1, which is ineviably but have their chisq(~0.87) usually smaller than the signal fitting(0.88-1.0)
    2. For submerged channel, 2fold cannot effectively improve the AUC compare to 1fold(please see the ROC next section). Multi-fold might be a good plan for vacuum channels and NR events.  
* Stat of noise fitting amplitudes
    Stat has been made with 1000 set of MMC noise traces with noise power of 33.2.  
    So to get more information/validation I made the ROC

* The turning point of threshold for rejecting fake signals. Since the trigger is event-wise, the turning point expected to be higher than the average width of fitting ampl for noise traces.

### Study on the 2-fold

To study whether 2-fold a better trigger for ur design I plot the one fold ROC and two fold ROC together for comparison, and extracted the information below
1. AUC Comparison: The 2-fold trigger shows a smaller AUC than the 1-fold, indicating reduced overall performance.
2. Check the threshold value at FPR==0.05. The value of thresholds indicate: 
    i. Threshold Value: The 1-fold threshold is significantly higher than the 2-fold, as expected, since 2-fold compares the second-largest amplitude.

    ii. True Positive Rate (TPR): At the same FPR, 1-fold achieves a higher TPR. This suggests the 2-fold threshold fails to reject noise effectively, and many valid single-channel UV signals are missed, lowering TPR.

3. ER vs NR ROC: The ROC curves for ER and NR events are nearly identical, confirming that the NR template is well defined.
4. Same Threshold Behavior: At the same threshold, the 2-fold trigger yields both lower TPR and FPR, consistent with expectations.
5. TPR at Low FPR: At low FPR, TPR is higher for ER events than NR, suggesting the UV-based trigger more efficiently collects energyâ€”likely because UV signals are confined to one channel, whereas QPs spread over multiple channels.

### AUC as a function of recoil energy for True samples
1. Setup: Fixed OF amplitude fitting with channel-wise templates. Samples with energy from 5 to 50, with NR and ER mixed(100+100 per energy point). Haven't observed evidence 2fold has better performance than one.

2. 2Fold may able to efficiently reject the fake signal, but by comparison at same TPR level, haven't observed evidence.

### Conversion of theoretical noise spectrum into noisePSD
1. TODO, plan to give some coefficient to make the theoretical spectrum convert into PSD with same magnitude as the MMC noise we gained for paper.

### Question
* For the noise traces with amplitude, they usually have chisq ~0.87 and is smaller than the chisq for fitting signal traces, could this be used for classifier?  
* multi-fold might be useful for vac channel, should I spend time study whether and how much?
* What else study would be helpful, any preference on priority?
